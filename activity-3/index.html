                <p>"Just compiled the source code, pretty cool they let you do that if you know how to
                     instead of buying it. Awesome software (and a sick style, never seen anything like it)"</p>

                <p>"Yep, I'm sold.  I've been battling with GIMP for my pixel art needs, and while it kinda works,
                     it just doesn't have the stuff I need.  This looks useful, it's cheap (and good), and there's no hokey license thing to deal with."</p>
